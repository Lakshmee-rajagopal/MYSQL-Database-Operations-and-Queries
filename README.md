# MYSQL-Database-Operations-and-Queries 

**Description:**
In this activity, MySQL is used to perform various database operations and write queries. Began by creating and altering tables in the `global_store_db` database, then proceeded to populate these tables with sample data. Have also practiced writing SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, including tasks such as grouping, summarizing, and joining tables. Additionally, a view is created to manage product pricing and have executed a join query to link product details with order information.
